# Acoustic-Fire-Extinguisher

### Acoustic Fire Extinguisher is a type of fire extinguisher which uses sound waves to extinguish the fire rather than using the chemical compounds used by traditional fire extinguishers.

#### This type of extinguisher can be more safe than the traditional ones as it doesn't use any chemical compounds which can cause health risks or property damage. With the current development, Acoustic Fire Extinguisher is able to put off small fires but it's a great development for the start.

#### By focusing bass sound waves into a specific direction, the acoustic fire extinguisher ability to manipulate both oxygen and burning material is maximized. Because sound is a pressure wave that oscillates between regions of high and low pressure, the oscillation can be exploited to create a vacuum that separates air molecules from the sounds of the flame, putting out the fire.

#### This projects includes serverals ML models: Random Forest Regression, Single Neutral Network, and Deep Neutral Network to predict the probability of extinguish the fire
